                -- Installation --

Installation works through the Waf build system. You can obtain Waf by
running the included bootstrap script:

    $ ./bootstrap.py

Once installed, you must configure the project like so:

    $ ./waf configure

You can use the --prefix option to specify where to install to. This
defaults to "/usr/local" normally. The --check-d-compiler switch can be
used to specify which compiler to build with. This will typically be
"dmd", "gdc", or "ldc".

The DAREPL Waf script also supports some additional options:

    * --lp64 (= "true")
      - Whether to build for 64-bit pointers.
    * --mode (= "debug")
      - Which mode to build in. Building in "debug" disables any and
        all optimizations, while "release" enables optimization and
        inlining. Note that both modes will generate debug information
        and emit array bounds checks.

For example, to build for a 32-bit CPU, do:

    $ ./waf configure --lp64=false

Or to include Vim syntax files:

    $ ./waf configure --vim=~/.vim

You will likely want to build a release version if you're not a
contributor to the project, so:

    $ ./waf configure --mode=release

With the project configured, you can execute a build by doing:

    $ ./waf build

To install the project:

    $ ./waf install

Should you wish to uninstall the installed files at a later point,
simply execute:

    $ ./waf uninstall
