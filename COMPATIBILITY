            == DAREPL: D Architecture REPL ==

                -- Compatibility --

DAREPL generally requires version 2.0 of the D language.

The following compilers are supported:

    * Digital Mars D (DMD)
    * GNU D Compiler (GDC)
    * LLVM D Compiler (LDC)

DAREPL will probably compile even if you're using an unsupported
compiler, but we cannot in any way guarantee support.

DAREPL can be built on any architecture, but the list of architectures
that the REPL actually supports emulation for is:

    * x86 (32-bit and 64-bit)
    * ARM (32-bit)
    * PowerPC (32-bit and 64-bit)
    * Itanium (64-bit)
    * MIPS (32-bit and 64-bit)
